m + d : 2 min
d: 1 min (or m)
da + s :5 min 
m: 2 min (or d)
m + d : 2 min 
= Total = 12 min

constraints 
================
2 people max per route 
12 min in total ( 1 torch only)  
specific speed family members: slowest speed counts 

solution 
===============
slowest couple should use the tunnel only 1 time 
slowest need to go together: daughter and son 
fastest ones for the return route

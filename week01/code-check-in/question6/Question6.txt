First of all, my goal is here to print something repetitive. 
I want to print numbers from 1-100. For this I just need a loop, which starts at 1 goes up to 100. Loop can execute the following code as much as predefined.
For each time I need to print the number, and add 1 to that number before going out the loop.(First line of code in parantheses, i defined starting point, condition, and increment statement)
According to our task I have to need print "Power" instead of multiples of 5, and "Coders" instead of multiples 7 and "Powercoders" instead of multiples of five and seven(5*7). 
Before printing the numbers i am going to check the numbers if it is a multiple of 5,7 and 35. For that calculation i need to check the remainder after division. It is a simple Math.
In that particular situations I am going to print the desired strings. Otherwise the program prints the number itself. To check that particular situations i can use if-else statements or switch-case.
On that lines my program checks the numbers whether they have these conditions or not. 


I can build my algorithm in Java, in which i feel comfortable, than i can write it with javascript.

	for (int i=1; i <=100; i++) {
      if(i%(5*7) == 0) {
        System.out.println("Powercoders");
        continue;
      } else if (i%5 == 0) {
        System.out.println("Power");
      } else if (i%7 == 0) {
        System.out.println("Coders");
      } else System.out.println(i);
    }
	
now i need to adapt this algorithm to JS. It is almost the same.

	for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
		if(i%(5*7)==0) {
			console.log("Powercoders");
			continue;
		} else if (i%5 == 0) {
			console.log("Power"); 
		} else if (i%7 == 0) {
			console.log("Coders");
		} else console.log(i);
	}

**But we should be careful about the line that check the number if it is a multiple of (5*7). Because these numbers are still a multiple of 5 and 7. 
That is why i use "continue" statement. With that statement, it will no longer execute the following line go directly to the next number in the loop and execute from the first line.

there are various ways to do this calculation. i can define variables not to use hardcoded numbers or use switch case instead of if statement or another print methods from javascripts.
